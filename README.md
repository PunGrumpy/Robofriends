# RoboFriends

## Exercise

<details> <summary>What is <code>React.StrictMode</code>?</summary> <p><b>The React.StrictMode</b> is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. Like Fragment, StrictMode does not render any visible UI. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. StrictMode currently helps with: <ul> <li>Identifying components with unsafe lifecycles</li> <li>Warning about legacy string ref API usage</li> <li>Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage</li> <li>Detecting unexpected side effects</li> <li>Detecting legacy context API</li> </ul></p> </details>

<details><summary>What is <b>JSON Placeholder</b>?</summary><p><b>JSON Placeholder</b> is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data. Itâ€™s a great tool for prototyping and mocking APIs. You can use it to test your code, or to quickly wire up an API for a prototype.</p></details>

## Tips

`props.children` is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
